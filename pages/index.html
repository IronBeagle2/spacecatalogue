    New website design! It's retro themed because I really really like old websites.

    Going to be reformatting the solar system section to make it at least somewhat solid
    soon-ish. Probably tomorrow. =)

<h3>Figuring stuff out.</h3>
<p>

    Trying to figure out how the entire website will be layed out. So far, all I know is
    that solar system objects will be in /solar-system/, fairly simple! However with
    stuff like galaxies, I don't know how the folders will work. Maybe I'm just getting
    ahead of myself and should instead work on the solar system objects....

<h3>Solar system section is being worked on.</h3>

    So far I've added names of the planets, and I'm finishing some formatting stuff like
    the infobox seen on Earth's page!

<h3>The site is up!</h3>

    The site is very bare bones so far, and is still work in progress.
