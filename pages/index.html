Going to be reformatting the solar system section to make it at least somewhat solid soon-ish. Probably tomorrow. =)<br><br>

<b>Figuring stuff out.</b><br>

Trying to figure out how the entire website will be layed out. So far, all I know is that solar system objects will be
in /solar-system/, fairly simple! However with stuff like galaxies, I don't know how the folders will work. Maybe I'm
just getting ahead of myself and should instead work on the solar system objects....<br><br>

<b>Solar system section is being worked on.</b><br>
Posted by Admin on <date><i>19.12.2021</i></date><br>
So far I've added names of the planets, and I'm finishing some formatting stuff like the infobox seen on Earth's
page!<br><br>

<b>The site is up!</b><br>

The site is very bare bones so far, and is still work in progress.
